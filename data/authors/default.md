<h1>Hi</h1>
-----------
--------------

My name is **Milad Ezzat** and I’m a **JS Champion**, I wrote about software engineering.

Experienced, passionate, and self-motivated technical operations leader with a diverse history spanning every facet of software design, development, deployment, and maintenance.

Most comfortable on the cutting edge, loves to learn and explore, and is truly inspired by today’s emerging technologies and methodologies. 

I have a strong passion for learning and exploring new technologies and methodologies, which led me to pursue two Nanodegree programs from Udacity in front-end and React development in 2020. I also have certifications in HTML, CSS, Linux, and Python from Udemy and Coursera. I enjoy working with Nextjs, Expressjs, and Algolia, as well as other open-source tools and frameworks. My goal is to create innovative and user-friendly solutions that solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

I'm currently developing various open-source projects (e.g. [encrypt-rsa](https://encrypt-rsa.js.org)).
