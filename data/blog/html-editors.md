# HTML Editors
A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.

## Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit

Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.
However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).
We believe in that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.

## Step 1: Open Notepad (PC) 
Windows 8 or later:
Open the ***Start Screen*** (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type *** Notepad ***.

Windows 7 or earlier:
Open *** Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad ***

## Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac)
Open ***Finder > Applications > TextEdit***
Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In ***Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"**
Then under ***"Open and Save"***, check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".
Then open a new document to place the code.

## Step 2: Write Some HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Step 3: Save the HTML Page

Save the file on your computer. Select ***File > Save as*** in the Notepad menu.
Name the file ***"index.htm"*** and set the encoding to ***UTF-8** (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).

> Tip: You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference, it is up to you.

## Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").

The result will look much like this:
