## Database Management System

It's a collection of programs that enable the users of the organization to create and maintain databases and control all access to them.

> A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized data-keeping system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself.


### Facilities provided by a DBMS

1. **Defining**
  A database involves defining the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database.

2. **Constructing**
  The database is the process of storing the data on a storage device that is controlled by the DBMS.

3. **Manipulating**
  A database involves querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the database, etc.

4. **Sharing**
  A database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously.
