## What are benefits of using the database approach?

1. **Control of data redundancy**
In the database approach, ideally, each data item is stored in only one place in the database. This is known as **data normalization**.

2. **Data sharing**
The integration of all the data for an organization within a database system has many advantages. First, it allows for
data sharing among employees and others who have access to the system. Second, it gives users the ability to generate more information from a given amount of data than would be possible without the integration.


3. **Enforcement of integrity constraints**
Database management systems must be able to define and enforce certain constraints to ensure that users enter valid information and maintain data integrity. **A database constraint** is a restriction or rule that dictates what can be entered or edited in a table.

4. **Restriction of unauthorized access**
Not all users of a database system will have the same access privileges

5. **Backup and recovery facilities**
Backup and recovery are methods that allow you to protect your data from loss. The database system provides a facility for backing up and recovering data
