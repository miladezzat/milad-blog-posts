It is a term to describe **DTL**, or **Distributed Ledger Technology**, Blockchain is used to create a storage system for data in a **distributed** and **immutable** manner.

> A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party. 


### Immutability

This means that once data is written to a blockchain data store or ledger, it cannot be changed, with any normal database like: relational databases or non-relational database, there is a user (admin, hacker, etc) can retrieve and modify it.
But with **blockchain** when the data is written to the system it's impossible to change it, if a bit of data changed the entire system will report an `invalid` state.

### Distribution

> A distributed system in its most simplest definition is a group of computers working together as to appear as a single computer to the end-user. These machines have a shared state, operate concurrently and can fail independently without affecting the whole system's uptime.

The one key of blockchain is the trust, It uses the distribution to save the trust, it make copy from all data to all peers at the network (channel). -Replicating the datastore on a number of peers(hosts) on the internet .
